        The idea is that we create two pointers, a slow one and a fast one. 
        The slow pointer traverses the linked list 1 node at a time, while 
        the fast pointer traverses the linked list 2 nodes at a time.
        If at some point the two pointers meet on the same node, 
        then that means a cycle exists.
